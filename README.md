## WAPRO Demo Meteor

In the snake pit, you will be competing for your survival. Be quick as it becomes increasingly harder to continue the longer you survive. Dominate the other players by feeding your snake the most.

## How to play

The game is played with the arrow keys. Be careful not to run into any other snakes or yourself. The other snakes are colored <span style="color:red">red</span> and your food is colored <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>. Guide your snake to eat food while avoiding collisions. You may go through walls and find yourself on the opposite side of the pit. Also gain points by trapping other snakes and ending them.
